#+TITLE: Axios: AJ(SON)AX.

We are trying to avoid using NPM packages wherever possible as we do not want to
rely an that many upstreams.

Axios was the first one I was using as a node_module in the wrong spot.

* Installation

#+begin_src shell
cd /tmp/ ; cd $(mktemp -d);
wget https://github.com/axios/axios/archive/refs/tags/v0.24.0.tar.gz
tar zxvf *

mv -v axios* ~/me/src/PostgresUI/axios/
# => renamed 'axios-0.24.0/' -> '/home/drewc/me/src/PostgresUI/axios/'
#+end_src
